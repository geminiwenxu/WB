Four days later, the United Kingdom, Russia, Austria, and Prussia mobilised armies to defeat Napoleon. Critically outnumbered, Napoleon knew that once his attempts at dissuading one or more members of the Seventh Coalition from invading France had failed, his only chance of remaining in power was to attack before the coalition mobilised.\\nHad Napoleon succeeded in destroying the existing coalition forces south of Brussels before they were reinforced, he might have been able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war.

Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty.\\nThe initial dispositions of Wellington, the British commander, were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through Mons to the south-west of Brussels. This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by Gebhard Leberecht von BlÃ¼cher, but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at Ostend.

He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on Quatre Bras, where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing. Prince Bernhard and General Perponcher were by all accounts better informed of the French advance than other allied officials and their later initiatives to hold the cross roads proved vital for the outcome.

The bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight, and some elements did not move out until the following morning, ignored by the French.\\nCrucially, the Prussians did not retreat to the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they, too, fell back northwardsâ€”parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout.

BlÃ¼cher's army was gathering in and around Wavre, around 8 miles (13Â\\xa0km) to the east of the town.
